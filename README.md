# Escape-Room
SOFTENG 206 - Escape Room

Worked independently to develop an escape room game using JavaFx and Scene Builder to meet the client's requirements.

Utilized OpenAI's GPT API through Java to drive the flow of the game.

Frequently attended client mettings and participated in weekly sprint meetings.

## To setup OpenAI's API

- add in the root of the project a file named `apiproxy.config`
- put inside the credentials in the format:
- email:
- apiKey:
  
## To run the game

./mvnw clean javafx:run
